## About me

I'm a full stack web developer with 2 years of experience and multiple personal experiences.

I started my programming career in 2018 while I was still in high school, which was integrated with technical education. I graduated in Systems Development Technician.

Since then I have been developing my skills in React JS, Node JS, React Native doing course projects, personal projects, freelancers and among others.

I¬¥m a person passionate about technology and I always try to stay up to date with the latest trends in the sector. I¬¥m easy to learn new technologies and I¬¥m always looking for challenges that allow me to expand my knowledge and improve my skills as a developer.

I¬¥m excited about the possibility of contributing to challenging projects and working as a team to create innovative solutions. My approach is focused on providing clean, modular and high quality code, following the best development practices.

I¬¥m available to discuss collaboration opportunities and share more about my previous projects and experiences.
